# move — and won; hyprland was removed 2026-07.) Fonts and Wayland-wide env
# stay in modules/desktop.nix (compositor-agnostic); the greeter is DMS on
# greetd (modules/dms-greeter.nix). The USER half (config.kdl glue) lives
# in home/niri.nix; the desktop shell — bar, lock screen, idle policy —
# is DMS (home/dms.nix).

  # System-level enable does things home-manager can't — and the nixpkgs
  # module tracks upstream's "Important Software" recommendations exactly:
  #  * installs the wayland-session .desktop file (the greeter menu finds
  #    "Niri"). Its Exec is `niri-session`, which is systemd-NATIVE: niri
  #    runs as a user unit (niri.service), imports WAYLAND_DISPLAY into the
  #    user manager itself, and only then activates graphical-session.target.
  #    No uwsm anywhere — niri needs no external session manager.
  #  * portals per upstream recommendation: adds xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
  #    and writes a niri-portals.conf routing default→gnome,gtk /
  #    Secret→gnome-keyring. Since the 2026-07 KDE-plumbing migration we
  #    REROUTE most of that below: every dialog-ish interface goes to the
  #    KDE portal, and only the capture family stays GNOME — it has to,
  #    because xdg-desktop-portal-gnome is the ONLY screencast backend niri
  #    supports (niri implements org.gnome.Mutter.ScreenCast; xdp-kde's
  #    capture code speaks KWin's private zkde_screencast protocol instead).
  #    Portal routing is per-desktop (picked by XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP at
  #    login), so it composes with the fallback GTK portal in desktop.nix.
  #  * enables gnome-keyring — overridden back OFF in modules/kwallet.nix,
  #    where ksecretd (KDE) is the session keyring now.
  #  * swaylock PAM (security.pam.services.swaylock) — set by this module
  #    directly. Unused since the locker became DMS's (which authenticates
  #    against /etc/pam.d/login instead — see modules/dms.nix), but
  #    harmless: it's upstream's unconditional default, not something we
  #    can or need to turn off.
  # Window-manager *configuration* comes from home-manager.

  # The nixpkgs niri module defaults useNautilus=true: it puts the full
  # Nautilus package on the session bus so xdg-desktop-portal-gnome can use
  # Nautilus's dialog as the FileChooser. Two problems since the file manager
  # went to Dolphin (2026-07): every app's open/save dialog was secretly
  # Nautilus, and Nautilus's D-Bus dir also claims org.freedesktop.FileManager1
  # — so "reveal in folder" (1Password etc.) opened Nautilus, not Dolphin.
  # false = keeps Nautilus out of the closure and Dolphin the only
  # FileManager1 provider. (The FileChooser→gtk route it writes is
  # overridden to kde just below.)

  # ── Portal routing: KDE for dialogs, GNOME only for capture ─────────────
  # The KDE portal serves everything interactive: file dialogs (KIO,
  # matching Dolphin), notifications (forwarded to org.freedesktop.
  # Notifications, i.e. the DMS shell), Access prompts, and Settings — note that
  # means apps now read the color-scheme preference from kdeglobals, not
  # gsettings (neither is set today; future dark-mode work targets
  # kdeglobals). The niri module hard-sets these keys as plain coerced
  # strings, so overriding same keys needs mkForce (a second plain
  # definition is an eval conflict); the gnome pins are NEW keys — today
  # they fall through `default=gnome` — and merge without force. They exist
  # because the whole capture family (ScreenCast/Screenshot/RemoteDesktop)
  # in xdg-desktop-portal-kde is hard-wired to KWin's private
  # zkde_screencast protocol: routed to kde they wouldn't just be untested,
  # they'd be certainly broken. GNOME capture is the permanent exception to
  # the KDE plumbing — do not "finish" the migration by flipping these.
  # (Secret→kwallet lives in modules/kwallet.nix: one file per intent, so
  # deleting the keyring module deletes its route.)
